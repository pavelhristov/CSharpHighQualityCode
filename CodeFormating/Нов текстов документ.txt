Files are not ordered in folders.

1.event.cs:
	Have not renamed anything except file name(couldn't leave it lowercase).
	Have could not say if the code is running: one of the libraries is missing.
	Have not added any comments, homework is about formating not comments (style cop still not happy enough).
2.bunnies.cs:
	Renamed only the file name.
	Was not sure if I have to move out in separate file Enum and Interface as they are only used in their parent class.
	Code is running and doing what it looks like it is supposed to do (added 1 missing ", was not looking nice without it).
	Changed some var-s to correct types, left some where type is unimportant.
	Finding comments in Main() pointless as the steps are obvious and comments explain nothing more.
3.code.js
	Have not bothered with eval(), homework is about formating ... I gues.
	Comments were on point, sadly it is better without them.
